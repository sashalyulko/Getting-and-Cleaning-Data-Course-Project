# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The run_analysis.R file loads the subjects' id's, activity list and the measurement data;
combines test and training data sets;
selects only the data with the means and std's of the measurements;
labels the new set of variables with the descriptive labels;
names activities with descriptive activity names and 
writes the data set as a table.
